        In Numbers 21:6–9, we read a brief yet powerful account of the brass serpent. When it was raised up, all who looked upon it were healed and lived. This moment stands as a profound symbol of the Lord Jesus Christ, who would be lifted up so that all who look to Him in faith might receive life. Although the passage in Numbers is concise, the Book of Mormon provides further insight. In Helaman 8:14–16, the prophet expounds upon the symbolism of the brass serpent, teaching that it pointed directly to Christ and His saving power. Together, these scriptures form a beautiful bridge between the Bible and the Book of Mormon, offering a unified and powerful testimony of the Lord.

        As I reflect on these verses, I am reminded of the importance of recognizing Christ in every part of scripture. The Lord has given us multiple witnesses of His mission and atoning sacrifice, not only to strengthen our understanding but also to deepen our faith. Studying both the Bible and the Book of Mormon together reveals patterns and connections that illuminate His role as Redeemer more clearly than either record alone. These combined testimonies invite us to look to Him continually, not just in moments of trial, but in every step of our journey so that we too, may find healing, strength, and eternal life when we look unto Him. How have reading from multiple sets of scriptures helped you undersand Christ more clearly in your own life than just the one?
